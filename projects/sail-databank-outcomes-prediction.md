# Predicting outcomes using SAIL Databank

**Keywords:** Machine Learning, Pathway Analysis, Data Representation, Modelling

**Need:** The collections of linked health datasets into a single research environment creates a number of large opportunities for insight and analysis.  Whilst anonymised extracts from these environments have great value, there is an even larger opportunity to develop methods of deploying modelling to the data remotely.  [The SAIL Databank - The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank](https://saildatabank.com/) provides anonymised person-based data for research powered by the Secure e-Research Platform.  This project would seek to investigate methods for deploying data science algorithms on the SAIL Databank.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:**  Information on the data contained within the SAIL Databank can be found on their site - https://saildatabank.com/saildata/sail-datasets/.  
A list of previous projects can be found here: https://saildatabank.com/wp-content/uploads/Current-Projects-Jul-2021.pdf and potential use-cases here: https://saildatabank.com/saildata/uses-for-sail-data/.  

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a

**Enables Future Work:** Any open demonstration of analysis of large linked datasets is of use to the NHS but more so the application of remote modelling.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** 
- Machine Learning on data
- Pathway analysis on data
- Graph-based data representations
- Modelling capabilities within SAIL

**Datasets:** SAIL Databank Datasets

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around machine learning, population health management, validation and bias, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
